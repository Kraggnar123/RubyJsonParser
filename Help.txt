# How to Run Program
# Step 1: Open Terminal In Correct Directory: 'Project'.
# Step 2: Type In Terminal 'ruby JsonConverter.rb file.json'
# As long as the JSON Syntax Is Correct This Will Run Well. Minus The Last Comma As Quoted On https://gist.github.com/samsworldofno/6d7a1e5daad5dd150e45622549ac6741.

# Other Ways Of Doing The Project:
# - While It Is Posisble To Hardcode The JSON To A Variable, It's Not Practicle Due To Useability And Code Reuse.
# - Possible To Use Regular Expression; Although Not Necessary As Ruby Has Library Method Does that and JSON Convertion.

# Limitation of this code:
# - Struggles To Handle Multiple Lines Of The Same JSON Code. If i had kept the file open, I could have coded it to handle this. For the purpose of the task I have not done this.
